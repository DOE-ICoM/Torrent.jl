Produces time traces of the reservoir volume and dam height (returned

# Arguments
- `breach_width_top`: Width of the top of the breach (in meters).
- `breach_width_bottom`: Width of the bottom of the breach (in meters).
- `initial_reservoir_volume`: Initial reservoir volume at start of the breach
  (in cubic meters).
- `reservoir_depth_curve`: A function representing the reservoir depth curve.
  This function should take a reservoir volume (in cubic meters) and return
  a depth (in meters).
- `initial_dam_height`: Dam height at start of simulation
- `final_dam_height`: Dam height at end of breach
- `failure_period`: Time period (seconds) over which breach occurs, resulting
  linear reduction in the dam height.
- `time_step`: Length of a time step in seconds.
- `num_steps`: The number of time steps to take during the simulation.
